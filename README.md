# ERC1155 Snapshot Tool
### ðŸ“¸ Snapshot a single ERC1155 token owners with balance. 

---  

âœ¨ A more recent tool is available under [vngnc3/ercsnapshot](https://github.com/vngnc3/ercsnapshot), capable of snapshotting previous block for ERC-721 collection.

---   

ðŸ“¤ Exports as JSON object and CSV file.  

âŒš This tool is unable to snapshot a previous block, due to the limitations in alchemy-web3 library, and reliability issues in Alchemy NFT API.    

âš¡ This tool is due for an upgrade when Alchemy NFT API reliability issues have been resolved. The `getOwnersForContract()` endpoint will sometime return incorrect token balances. Hence, the use of slower `getNfts()` endpoint for more accurate result.  

ðŸ”° &nbsp;Use at your own risk, always verify, do your own research.

## Maintenance

I created this tool to enhance the experience I'm creating with my NFT collections. Specifically the ever-ongoing [Incomplete Design](https://id.xxxxizzy.eth.limo/) and the experiments I'm doing around it.
